## Hints
* Use the section under `if __name__ == '__main__': ` to change arguments and check your work.
* When you are happy with your code, use `input()` to prompt the user for a value.
* Add code to [my_code.py](./my_code.py) to make it do the desired thing.
* Run your code with: `python my_code.py` or the run button
* Run your tests with: `pytest`
