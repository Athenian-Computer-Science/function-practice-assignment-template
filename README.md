# Functions practice
This repo should be used in conjunction with CS class and the [Functions handout](https://github.com/maleich/CS-lesson-plans/blob/master/Functions.md) here and in OneNote.

## Problem Description
There are a few different files to modify/use in this repo. Please read the instructions carefully. 
1) Calling functions:
  - Predictions:
    - Read the code [call_functions_predict.py](call_functions_predict.py). Predict the output and write your prediction in the comment area at the end of the program.
    - Run the program and check your predictions. If you were incorrect, be sure you can figure out why.
  - Editing:
    - Open the code [call_functions_edit.py](call_functions_edit.py). Rearrange the function calls so the output is in a logical order.
    - Define a new function that tells the user a joke (you decide on the function name and the joke). Call it in a sensible place in the program. Remember that function definitions go at the top of the program, so place your function in an appropriate location.
2) Returns
  - 

## Example
```
Value to increment? 5
10
```

## Hints
* Use the section under `if __name__ == '__main__': ` to change arguments and check your work.
* When you are happy with your code, use `input()` to prompt the user for a value.
* Add code to [my_code.py](./my_code.py) to make it do the desired thing.
* Run your code with: `python my_code.py` or the run button
* Run your tests with: `pytest`
